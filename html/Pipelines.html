                                    <p>The pipeline industry is undeniably a very lucrative industry, and this is shown by how there is a lot of support from the government even when numerous people raise concerns for the environment and the indigenous communities where nature is sacred. As more pipeline projects continue to get financial support, this support showcase the way that western imperialism continues undermining the voices and rights of the indigenous people.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>In the article <a href="https://doi.org/10.1057/s41271-019-00186-1" target="_blank" >Oil Pipelines and Food Sovereignty: Threat to Health Equity for Indigenous Communities<sup>1</sup></a>; Hurlbert, Margot A and Datta, Ranjan say how the importance that government officials and investors give to pipeline infrastructures showcase whose voice they deem more important, and this removes the credibility for the indigenous concerns for their land and their resources, this also cause a power imbalance where indigenous culture is affected due to displacement and the ongoing scatter of fishes and other animals due to the ecological effect caused by pipelines.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Margot A and Ranhan argue that disregarding the ecological and cultural value of Indigenous territories reinforces colonial narratives that prioritize economic interests over Indigenous rights. The creation of pipelines is at the cost of indigenous land whose well-being, health, and way of life are impacted as they hold deep connections with the land. Indigenous communities view their land not just as a resource but as part of their cultural heritage. Their resistance against resource extraction projects is about more than physical structures; it’s about preserving ecosystems, biodiversity, and sacred sites. With this prioritization of pipeline constructions over the voices of indigenous people, there is perpetuation of their ongoing struggle to be heard on important matters.</p>

                                    <p >Pipelines, when ruptured, release chemicals that can cause irreparable harm to the environment. Researchers Jonasson et al. emphasize that pipeline ruptures have detrimental effects, as seen in the contamination of the Tsleil-Waututh Nation’s food, particularly shellfish. Elevated biotoxin levels in these shellfish result from their proximity to crude oil pipelines in their traditional territory. This situation not only impacts animals but also humans who rely on these lakes for sustenance. The potential for pipelines to cause lasting harm to both the environment and people is evident.                            </p>
                                    <p>Moreover, pipelines disrupt local food chains by increasing biotoxin levels in animals near the pipeline. This can lead to the death of other organisms that depend on these animals for sustenance, posing a serious threat to public health. Additionally, pipeline expansion can trigger algae growth due to high temperatures and nutrient influx during ruptures. Algae consumes organic matter introduced into the water, leading to oxygen depletion and affecting aquatic organisms’ growth and photosynthesis. This imbalance can endanger aquatic life.                            </p>
