        <h2>Indigenous Voices</h2>
        <P>The pipeline industry is profitable, but this industry is entangled in disputes over environmental and indigenous issues. These disputes stem from the fears of ecological harm and public health threats due to the potential pipeline leaks, mixed with the disregard for the indigenous community's perspectives when pipelines are constructed on their territories. The building of pipelines impairs the risk to local ecosystems and further sideline indigenous communities.</P>
