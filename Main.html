        <p>
            Throughout human history, people have witnessed the darkest forms of human rights violations such as prejudice, fear and cruelty.
            Paticularly the revolting occurrence that leaves a lasting stain on human history everytime it occurs is ethnic cleansing and genocide.
            Ethnic cleansing and genocide are one of the servere forms of human rights violations.
            The events that are not so different from each other, carries a significant weight of unimaginable suffering, systemic violence, and the deliberate extinction of entire communities.
            By shedding light on this troubling practice, we aim to increase our understanding of the darkest sides of humanity, encourage people to think together, and stress the importance of preventing such terrible acts in our world.

        <h2>Indigenous Voices</h2>
        <P>The pipeline industry is profitable, but this industry is entangled in disputes over environmental and indigenous issues. These disputes stem from the fears of ecological harm and public health threats due to the potential pipeline leaks, mixed with the disregard for the indigenous community's perspectives when pipelines are constructed on their territories. The building of pipelines impairs the risk to local ecosystems and further sideline indigenous communities.</P>
