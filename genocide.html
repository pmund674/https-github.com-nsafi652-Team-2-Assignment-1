                            <p>Throughout human history, people have witnessed the darkest forms of human rights violations such as prejudice, fear and cruelty.

Ethnic cleansing and genocide are one of the servere forms of human rights violations.

            <p>Ethnic cleansing involves the deliberate and systematic expulsion of specific ethnic, racial, or religious communities from a particular area, aimed at achieving ethnic uniformity in that region. It involves acts such as mass killings, forced displacement, and destruction of property and cultural heritage, all with the goal of creating a more homogenous population in that area.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Genocide is the most extreme form of targeted violence against a specific group based on their national, ethnic, racial, or religious identity. It involves the intentional and systematic extermination or partial destruction of that group, with the aim of eradicating it entirely or in part. Genocide is considered a heinous crime under international law and represents the highest level of atrocity against humanity.

            <p>Genocide and ethnic cleansing are on of the greatest Catastrophic events caused by human actions. Including other forms of corruption caused by the government like war crimes and crimes against human rights, the consequent deaths caused during the 20th century alone was approximately 200 million. Understanding these catastrophic events can be crucial for several reasons:

                <p>A well-known historical example of ethnic cleansing and genocide is the Holocaust, which took place during World War II under the leadership of Nazi Germany. Though other minority groups were also persecuted, Jews were the main target of the Holocaust. During this horrific tragedy, synagogues and Jewish cultural heritage were destroyed, and almost six million Jews were methodically exterminated through mass killings, in forced labor camps and ghettos. Because of the Holocaust, which serves as a chilling reminder of the horrors of ethnic cleansing and genocide, international laws and organizations have been established to try to stop atrocities like this from happening in the future.

            <h3 id="RoleInternational">Role of International Community:</h3>
            <p>The international community needs to take a more proactive and strong stance in stopping and reacting to acts of ethnic cleansing and genocide. Even though international bodies like the UN have started to denounce and look into these activities, stronger action and more concrete measures are still desperately needed. In addition to denouncing the offenders, the international community needs to hold them accountable and provide significant assistance to the impacted communities. To make it abundantly evident that ethnic cleansing and genocide will not be accepted, concerted diplomatic efforts, severe sanctions, and enhanced intervention through peacekeeping missions and international criminal tribunals should be given top priority.

            <p>Although civilization seems to have evolved in the past generations and human rights are more preserved compared to previous generations, there are still acts of ethnic cleansing being committed in parts of the world. Currently Palestine is under attack by the Israelis and the palestinian people are facing genocide. 

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>In Gaza, the Israeli force is murdering 250 Palestinians on average per day, which is more deaths per day than in any other armed conflict of the twenty-first century. One Palestinian out of every 100 has been murdered and at least two Palestinians have been injured by Israeli attacks in Gaza in the last 100 days, many of whom have suffered life-altering injuries.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>This chilling death and injury toll occurs amidst a deliberately imposed humanitarian crisis by the Israeli authorities upon the 2.3 million Palestinian residents of Gaza. Ninety percent of Palestinians have been displaced from their homes, with many experiencing displacement on multiple occasions, notwithstanding that there is not a single place in Gaza that can be called safe. Due to the ongoing genocide in Gaza, every facet of life there has faced utter destruction.

            <h3 id="prevention">Prevention and Education:</h3>
            <p>For the purpose of increasing awareness and encouraging empathy, prevention and education play a critical role. Social media platforms are essential for sharing information and bringing attention to cases of ethnic cleansing and genocide in the current digital era.  By combining education with social media awareness, societies may increase their understanding of the seriousness of these crimes, take steps to prevent them, and become part of a more knowledgeable and compassionate international community that is dedicated to stopping ethnic cleansing and genocide.
